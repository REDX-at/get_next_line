Get Next Line is a project aimed at creating a function that reads a line from a file descriptor until a newline character is encountered. This project helps students gain deeper knowledge of file handling, buffers, and memory management in C.

## Introduction
The Get Next Line project teaches students how to handle file I/O operations in C, focusing on reading files line by line, regardless of the buffer size or file type. The function is designed to return each line from the file descriptor and manage memory efficiently to avoid leaks.

## Key Concepts
1. File Descriptors
Learn how file descriptors work and how they are used for reading from files or standard input. You'll work with low-level system calls like read to retrieve data from a file descriptor.

### 2. Dynamic Memory Allocation
Handle dynamically allocated memory using malloc and free. This project emphasizes the importance of managing memory correctly to prevent leaks or crashes when reading large files.

### 3. Buffers and Static Variables
Understand the role of buffers in storing data read from file descriptors, and how static variables can retain information between function calls, allowing you to manage partially read lines.

### 4. Efficient String Manipulation
Implement efficient string manipulation functions to join, split, and copy parts of the buffer as you process each line. This helps in handling variable line lengths.

### Features
Line-by-Line Reading: The function reads one line at a time from the file descriptor, handling any type of text file or input stream.
Dynamic Buffering: The function adapts to the buffer size, ensuring efficient memory use and preventing overflows.
Error Handling: Robust error handling for invalid file descriptors or memory allocation failures.
No Memory Leaks: Proper management of dynamically allocated memory to ensure there are no memory leaks.
